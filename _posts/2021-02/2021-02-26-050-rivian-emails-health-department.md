Mr. Rogers,

Good afternoon. I received your name from Grand County Planning Department and wanted to reach out and discuss a project I am involved with that will be submitted in the very near future for Planning approvals.

Rivian Automotive is an all-electric vehicle manufacturer and will be rolling out our all electric Amazon Prime Vans, R1T Truck, and R1S SUV the middle of 2021. They are currently in the process of purchasing 5.5 acres (Parcel #04-020-0042) just north of highway 313. The goal is to change the way electric vehicle driver’s view adventure and want to enable travel to key destinations such as Moab. Not only would this location enable charging solutions, but there is a plan to incorporate some basic amenities such as restrooms, seating area to enjoy the views, and basic vending (grab and go style with healthier options, not chips and candy bars).

The system will need to be designed by an onsite wastewater designer that holds the correct certification level for the type of system needed. See this list to find a professional: [https://documents.deq.utah.gov/water-quality/certification/DWQ-2017-000801.pdf](https://documents.deq.utah.gov/water-quality/certification/DWQ-2017-000801.pdf)

I can also only find online a permit for a large wastewater system. On the phone you mentioned a small wastewater permit. Can you send me a copy of that form or a link to where I can find it at? Just looked for the review application that would need provided with the design documents.

Thanks!
