# Utah's statewide mask mandate ends April 10; Grand's may continue.

Utah's statewide mask mandate is expected to end April 10 after the state's legislature passed a bill that would roll bakc the state's general mask mandate but keep in place the requirement for K-12 schools, large gatherings, and localities that order masks.

Grand County may be one of the areas that keeps its mask mandate beyond the April 10 end date. The current health order under which the Southeast Utah Health Department and Grand County Commission have placed the area is set to expire June 15.

According to Grand County Attorney Christina Sloan, the health department and commission may opt to end the mandate sooner. The state bill ending the statewide mandate would automatically terminate local mask mandates like Grand's if all of the following conditions are met:

- The state's 14-day case rate is **less than 191 per 100,000 people**;
- The statewide seven-day average COVID-19 ICU utilization is **less than 15%**; and
- **1,633,000 "prime doses"** of COVID-19 vaccine have been allocated to the state.

Here is where Utah stands as of March 9 on each of those metrics:

- The state saw **245 cases per 100,000 people** from Feb. 23 to March 9.
- **18%** of Utah's intensive care unit capacity was occupied by COVID-19 patients as of March 2.
- The federal government has **delivered 1,054,260 total doses** of COVID-19 vaccine to Utah, including second doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
