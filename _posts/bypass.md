## The bypass is not dead; long live the bypass

Moab City Council members recently complained at a joint meeting with the Grand County Commission and {hotspot committee} about an idea brought to them by Grand County Commissioner Curtis Wells and Moab Mayor Emily Niehaus to collect public input on the idea of constructing a bypass for Highway 191 through traffic to reroute the traffic off Main Street.

You have probably heard about this bypass idea before. The Utah Department of Transportation studied the idea, at the behest of local officials, but according to Grand County Commissioner Curtis Wells, the city and county have not come to a shared agreement on their stance on the matter.

The county commission and city council may never come to an agreement on the matter, at this rate. Every Moab City Council member during the meeting expressed some form of opposition to the bypass idea while county commissioners generally waffled on it.

Council Member Karen Guzman-Newton had told me days before the meeting that she was considering supporting the plan, but she apparently decided later to backpedal on that.

Council Member Rani Derasary expressed frustration at the prospect of even talking about the bypass again.

""

Council Member Tawny Knuteson-Boyd also expressed frustration.

""

Council Member Kalen Jones complained to me that Wells and Moab Mayor Emily Niehaus had put the subject on the agenda for the meeting, which he thought should have strictly focused on the three funding proposals from the {hotspot committee} that they came to the city council and county commission to approve.

According to Wells and Niehaus, this was just a simple proposal to collect data on public sentiment toward the project. Many Moabites talk about how badly the city needs a bypass; others, particularly those who live in the neighborhoods that would be most directly impacted by such a project, complain that the topic keeps coming back up.

The problem is that the topic will never go away. Traffic in Moab, just like traffic anywhere, will be a constant point of discussion until the day that the streets are suddenly clear of cars, trucks, UTVs, and semis. That day is not soon.

But how exactly do we resolve the discussion? It seems like talking about it might be a good idea, but the city council expressed a clear opposition to doing that.

Fortunately, cooler heads tend to prevail on the county commission, which not coincidentally was the body that collectively signaled that it had a less committed position on the matter during the Nov. __ discussion.
