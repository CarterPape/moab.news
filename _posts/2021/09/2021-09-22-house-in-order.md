# Election 2021: Getting Moab's house in order

## City council candidates

### Mike McCurdy

What structural, cultural, or other problems exist within the city that controversy over personnel (particularly, the city manager) repeatedly befall the institution? Is it just bad luck?

{% capture quote %}
I need to look at the controversy, not give an opinion that would add fuel to the fire. I want to gather the facts about what happened, interview the people involved, get the full story, then decide my stance.

Seeing what has happened in city hall, I see a need for the council to step up and listen to what appointed officials are dealing with. It is an issue that the resignations happened without the council aware there were problems.

I will be open at all times to listen and act to support city staff and be accountable to Moab.

Do you agree with Judge Don Torgerson's recent comments that the city police department "has a history that lacks quality oversight"? If so, what changes will you seek at the police department to address his concerns? If not, how do you respond to those comments?

{% capture quote %}
I am unfamiliar with Torgerson's comments. As a councilperson, I would address this situation with the city council, the mayor, and the police chief.

I understand the staffing shortage, but I would not let it be an excuse for bad behavior or a lack of following policy. We need a plan for how the department should be transparent to citizens and to the council.

I do not want to give an opinion without facts. As a council member, I would devote my time to staying involved and aware of what is happening in the city I represent.

I love this Rumi quotation so much, it's tattooed on my arm: "Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there."

I champion communication, justice, accountability, and integrity. I also know that truth often falls in a crossroads between subjective realities. I don't have enough firsthand or factual knowledge to diagnose current personnel issues, but I would prioritize promoting a healthy culture and regular assessment of the mechanics in our city government.

I spent seven seasons with Outward Bound teaching students (and myself) how to show up with tenacity and compassion. Let's start there.

{% capture quote %}
I think both nationally and locally, we should examine our institutions of public safety and scrutinize trends, especially around interactions with marginalized communities.

In 2019, Moab Pride hosted an incredible equity training that many non-profit employees attended. I'd love to see similar trainings for city staff and officials.

Maybe we need more enhanced training on effective use of body cameras and logging of incidents, or a streamlining of those systems. Personally, I have had positive interactions with our police force and am encouraged at Chief Edge's expressed commitment to cultivating a well-trained and diverse force and collaborating with social services.

{% capture quote %}
It does seem that the city's house is not in order.

I think it would be irresponsible to make assumptions about why Simonson resigned, and why Sukiennik accused the administration of "immoral and unethical favoritism", and ending with the secret resignation of Linares, without knowing the whole backstory.

If I were currently on city council, it would be top priority to get it figured out: finding the root of the issue and getting it resolved as quickly as possible. There is no room for this type of behavior or contention in city government.

{% capture quote %}
Judge Torgerson made his comments according to his experiences with the police department and camera use. The T-I article is the first I learned of the police department issue regarding this, and yes, if it's true and validated, it is concerning and needs to be fixed immediately.

Quality oversight should first come from the police chief and be overseen by the City Manager.  There could also be a need for an MPD review board where you have a qualified board that reviews reports and calls periodically to make sure laws and protocols are being followed.

### Anthony Charles

What structural, cultural, or other problems exist within the city that controversy over personnel (particularly, the city manager) repeatedly befall the institution? Is it just bad luck?

{% capture quote %}
There has always even a cloud over Moab’s city officials. Growing up here, I have seen bad ideas implemented poorly repeatedly. A lot of the time, it was a personal money grab.

Linares always gave me a direct answer to my questions. I think the council didn’t like him because he stood up for city employees, and to them, I guess that was bad business.

A few years ago, the State of Utardia said every city should go to the verge of bankruptcy, so if Moab is a corporation, this is the worst-ran business in the history of any corporation!

{% capture quote %}
The police department is being run to fail our community.

I asked Edge why we don’t have camera ticketers, and he said we would need someone to collect and type in the data. He said we don’t have the staff for that. The universal basic income could change that.

I know police watch UTVs run the Sand Flats and Mill Creek intersection. They are destroying the community by not ticketing dangerous drivers.

I watched a truck blow through the stop sign, and a sheriff’s officer just sat there in the cemetery driveway, texting and not watching or doing his job.

### Randall Fox

{% capture quote %}
Naked ambition and the strife that it causes are rampant in American society, so it’s predictable that we see some of it in Moab city government.

That said, I will also say that I hate bullying, nepotism, and dishonest behavior, and I have fought against such things as recently as this spring. They are like mold that thrives in dark places.

I intend to bring the sunlight and I will be ruthless. Our citizens deserve nothing less.

{% capture quote %}
I just read a learned commentary on the Moab Police Department’s interactions with Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie that was most complimentary of the officer’s actions and questioning as they pertained to a potential domestic abuse situation. It seems that they did all that they legally could.

But yes, it does appear that standards need to be raised in certain areas and situations, and despite the need to recruit and retain officers, we must not allow little things to slip by unnoticed that could become standard operating practice. Let’s be a city above reproach!

### Luke Wojciechowski

What structural, cultural, or other problems exist within the city that controversy over personnel (particularly, the city manager) repeatedly befall the institution? Is it just bad luck?

{% capture quote %}
I don’t have all the information about what is actually happening within city hall. Because of this, I think it would be irresponsible to make any sort of value judgment based on speculation rather than actual facts.

What I do know is that I strive for good communication, integrity, and accountability in my personal and professional life. Without these important pieces, lasting accomplishments and good relationships don’t happen.

Our entire community will be better and more efficiently served if we can address any internal turmoil early and promote competence, trust, and compassion between elected leaders, city staff, and the public.

{% capture quote %}
High-quality oversight is always needed, whether a government entity has a stellar history or one that needs improvement.

In Moab, law enforcement plays a difficult and complex role, so it is important to both support their good work and also quickly address community concerns as they arise.

I already have experience working with the Moab Police Department as Seekhaven’s representative on the Use of Force Policy Review Group, which is one way the department is working to better serve our whole community.

I would seek out other proactive ways to improve our citizens’ relationship to law enforcement if elected.

## Mayoral candidates

### Joette Langianese

What structural, cultural, or other problems exist within the city that controversy over personnel (particularly, the city manager) repeatedly befall the institution? Is it just bad luck?

{% capture quote %}
The staffing issues that have occurred at the city have nothing to do with luck. The city was fortunate to have a long-term city manager and mayor. It is not uncommon for disruptions when there is a transition to new leadership in any institution.

However, the controversy surrounding the initial replacement city manager did not help with that transition. At this point, it is imperative that the council move forward and take the opportunity to start fresh with a new leadership team.

{% capture quote %}
It is important to recognize that there are many hard-working officers within the Moab Police Department. These officers must deal with difficult situations on a daily basis.

It is not the Mayor’s role to question the judge’s rulings or comments on this case. Instead, the mayor needs to work with the city manager to ensure that the issues expressed are dealt with effectively and processes are implemented to allow for accountability and transparency.

{% capture quote %}
Clearly, there are problems in city hall. Things are not working as they should. Recent comments by the two judges and city attorney are concerning and must be taken seriously.

We must listen and commit to doing better. Exceptional people work in the police and other departments, but some need more support and training.

We need leadership that is accountable, which is why I am running for mayor. I’m not a local politician simply offering more of the same. I expect open, transparent leadership that cultivates trust and takes responsibility for making progress on complex issues Moab locals face.

Working with the city council, I plan to review the performance of all departments to ensure the city is performing to the highest standards in order to serve the Moab community in a fair and just way.

As mayor of Moab, I would work diligently to find long-term solutions to address recent community and regional concerns. I believe in strong leadership with teamwork and openness.

Where reforms and positive changes are needed, I would expect them to be enacted in a timely and decisive manner to benefit the broader public interest.

### Stephen J. Stocks

What structural, cultural, or other problems exist within the city that controversy over personnel (particularly, the city manager) repeatedly befall the institution? Is it just bad luck?

{% capture quote %}
The recent past indicates the city should revisit training and guidance for human resources. They are the first responders to employee’s concerns. There should be transparent processes for handling those concerns and a mechanism to report problems about the city manager to the mayor.

The city attorney should have a similar approach if the city manager does not remedy the concerns.

Furthermore, the city should be guided by core values. These can be drafted into a mission statement. The most paramount among those would be to treat each employee fairly, without regard to the employee’s connections or relationships.

{% capture quote %}
Policing is one of few government functions that, if done improperly, risks damaging trust, public safety, and human life. This demands a professional and well-managed police department. Supervision is critical. 

Every complaint or allegation against any officer should be fully addressed and vetted. This is doubly important if cases are dismissed due to improper preparation and presentation.

While this is the direct responsibility of the chief of police and the city manager, the mayor must be assured of follow-up by professional staff. The community has many dedicated officers who must be supported with leadership and guidance.

### Aaron Davies

{% capture quote %}
Since I have not worked within the city government system, I cannot judge what is or is not the cause of problems that we perceive from the outside.

My job as mayor would be to get to know the people on staff, learn how people interact with each other and find ways to improve. This would include working to create an atmosphere of mutual respect, a safe environment to express one’s views, encouraging kindness and collaboration.

My goal would be to have a community where we all have empathy and compassion for others, even when we disagree.{% endcapture %}

{% capture quote %}
I have a similar response to my first answer. My first task would be to talk with Chief Edge and gain an understanding of how his department works. I would look for ways to give him support and resources where available.

Law Enforcement agencies are understaffed throughout Utah. It is not just in Moab. The very nature of law enforcement has been attacked in recent months. They are often on the front lines of dealing with the anger, fear and hate in our culture.

We can all help to be a more compassionate, kind community.

I cannot pinpoint why we keep having these issues. The current process for hiring for these positions seems like it’s not working, and we need to change that.

One option would be to investigate how other municipalities have filled these critical positions and how they have dealt with similar strife. Moab City employees deserve to work in a safe and respectful environment, and we owe it to them to fix this issue.

I cannot make a comment on something that I have not been fully briefed on. If elected, one of my first meetings will be with the chief of police and city manager to discuss any ongoing issues (like Judge Torgerson’s comments) so I can better understand and make the right decision to help fix it.
