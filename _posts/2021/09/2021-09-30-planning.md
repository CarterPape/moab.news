# Planning: Sept. 30, 2021

My therapist got me into planning mode this morning, and I'm on a roll with it, so that's what I'm doing here.

## Here's what I'm doing for the rest of the day

1. schedule and plan the scheduling
    - figure out what I'm doing today (at least part of the day)
1. read letter **once** and respond to Taryn
1. interrupted by Doug to put Taryn story online
1. start computer updates
1. downhill work (not on computer, I suppose)
    1. get water bottles
    1. get samples into the water bottles
    1. mail the samples
1. lunch (this is a break!)
1. post the week 39 Q&A
1. make photos for the endorsement stories
