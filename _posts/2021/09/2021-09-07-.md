# Election 2021: Tourism and leading meetings

## council candidates

Moab already taxes lodgings at the maximum rate allowed by the state, and the city has limited space for commercial development. The city's primary lever for affecting the local economy is through changes to its zoning and land use regulations.

1. What will you do to bring quality jobs to Moab? If the efforts require funding, how will you pay for them?
1. Does Moab need to shrink the tourism industry, increase overall growth through greater commercial development, or do something else?

Moab has a unique opportunity right now to become a nexus for electrically powered mobility and solar power generation.

We need an expansion of the Utah State University campus to include a technical institute with a school of e-mobility.

Once the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action project wraps up, we will also have rail access for industry, and as the nation’s first Green Power Community, we already have a head start on solar power.

Surely there is a billionaire out there looking for a place that looks like Mars who can invest in a community to develop his rovers?

Does Moab need to shrink the tourism industry, increase overall growth through greater commercial development, or do something else?

{% capture quote %}
I have talked to so many local citizens who would _love_ to shrink the tourism industry, but no one can explain how they would achieve that other than a reduction in the State’s Mighty Five campaign.

What if we were to even out tourism year round instead by also becoming The Little City Of The Future? Shaded parking spaces at our shopping centers that are also solar panels. E-bikes, eMotorcycles, eOHVs, and electric trucks and cars everywhere you look.

And a university campus, fed in part by our excellent local school system, that is the envy of the nation.

We should keep honing our strategies for economic diversification. We have a skilled citizenry, with much of our talent pool under-utilized in a heavily service economy. Additionally, chronic vacancies in sectors like health care would be filled if we mitigated housing shortages and cost of living increases.

The city needs robust strategies for incubating new local businesses and tools like amending the commercial land use table to incentivize diverse industries.

We need to pursue grants and federal money to fund these goals and partner with the county when they're spending TRT money for economic development in the next year.

Does Moab need to shrink the tourism industry, increase overall growth through greater commercial development, or do something else?

{% capture quote %}
Our residents, watershed, and landscape are stressed, and so we need to be very deliberate about only growing in ways that benefit those who work and live here.

I think we need to bring tourism back to a more manageable scale and aim for quality over quantity in both visitorship and in our service economy, which will make the tourism experience more pleasant for visitors and residents alike.

I believe we are maxed out on overnight accommodations, and need to diversify our tourism industry as well, advocating for small, local businesses, local-friendly events, and services that benefit locals equally.

Moab already has many high-quality jobs available; however, employers are struggling to fill them due to housing.

Without directly addressing our housing crisis (both availability and affordability), efforts to diversify our job market or attract new businesses likely won’t work.

If the city focused even a little of its energy on grant writing, we could access significant new funding for both economic diversification and housing efforts without requiring the community to foot the bill.

We should also work with the county now that state law allows more Transient Room Tax money to go toward economic development instead of advertising.

Does Moab need to shrink the tourism industry, increase overall growth through greater commercial development, or do something else?

{% capture quote %}
Moab has limited resources, including water, and therefore has a limited capacity to grow. Because of these limits, we should focus future growth on things that diversify our economy or provide something desired by residents; we definitely don’t need more hotels.

We should encourage future commercial development but with a focus on keeping our town’s character alive and sustaining businesses that benefit locals whether or not tourists are around to use them too.

We should also support businesses that are small-scale but high-demand and aren’t inclined to exploit a community, such as handmade manufacturing and skilled trade work.

I think we all have our own idea of what a quality job is, to define that is up to each individual.

I personally would like to see more people have the opportunity to have a steady year-round income and to flatten the yearly boom and bust of employment in our town.

Economic diversification should be a priority for city leaders and something I will focus on if elected. The city funding “quality jobs” seems like an irresponsible use of city and taxpayer funds.

Does Moab need to shrink the tourism industry, increase overall growth through greater commercial development, or do something else?

{% capture quote %}
No! The only people that will benefit from shrinking tourism is a small portion of Moab that can afford higher property taxes, a higher cost of living, and don’t work in this industry to support their families.

For better or worse, tourism is currently a major part of how residents (roughly 60%) make a living in Moab; to shrink it would have a catastrophic ripple effect on our community.

I also think there is room to broaden and diversify the economy of Moab and Grand County, and we should move in the direction of having an economically diverse, year-round economy.

The Moab valley is full, so why can’t we create a new Moab City area out by the Dead Horse Point turn-off or out by the airport? That way, we have options.

Does Moab need to shrink the tourism industry, increase overall growth through greater commercial development, or do something else?

{% capture quote %}
Well, a universal basic income.

That means we create a 10-12% tax on the tourist industry, and for the first year, it goes into an account. The second year, we pay it out to all the year-round locals.

Set the payouts at $500 per month, and for the people here who are not year-round, $200-250 per month. Doing that will curb housing issues.

We will have to put a stop to rent increases. That’s why everyone gets it. This is not for greedy people. A homeowner that is renting a house cannot raise the rent in response.

## mayoral candidates

I believe the issues we are facing are the same issues we’ve been dealing with for some time now. Affordable housing is one of the biggest, along with traffic problems, and congestion in the city.

I think with proper management of these problems can be addressed, and we can make headway. Restructuring of zoning and requiring commercial projects to build housing for future employees are just a couple of ways to get started.

Almost every person I have spoken to has said the biggest issue in Moab is housing and the spending of our tax dollars.

I want to find realistic ways for us to get affordable housing in Moab, and to do so, I will look at all reasonable options. As for how our tax dollars are spent, I will work with city staff to examine the city budget and make appropriate adjustments.

I know that people can be passionate about their beliefs (especially on charged topics), and I want to hear from them --- but I also know that there has to be order and respect shown from all parties attending the meeting. I will make sure that people are heard and that order is kept in all meetings.

In Moab, it’s easy to be a tourist and hard to be a local, and it all comes back to housing.

As a general contractor for the last 18 years, I understand the intricacies of development and can advocate to find affordable solutions for the locals who want to call Moab home.

We need high-density housing, new development projects, and laws and policies that accommodate the immediate need to keep people safe.

I know how desperate we are for an answer to this issue. Our city depends on it, and I know I can deliver with the community’s support.

Many people are frustrated that the city isn’t "listening" to them. As mayor, I want to cultivate trust with the locals so that they feel like their government is representative of them.

I want to create an open and neutral atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable and valued sharing their opinion. We need to have a government that is working to have citizens feel cared for and is implementing practical solutions that deal with complicated issues.

This goes hand in hand with increasing communication, transparency and access to knowledge.

The top issues for most folks with whom I have spoken have been affordable housing (of course), lack of businesses for local residents to buy everyday items, balance of industry to living, residential ATV noise, and what this city can do for our young people ranging from 12 to 17. Folks of course care about many other topics as well.

There are various ways to advocate and enact the above. Some are easier than others. What should and can be done will be dealt with when I get there.

Moab’s citizens are concerned with ATV noise, affordable housing, and having a transparent, efficient, and effective government. I would encourage discussions by placing the topics of interest on the city council's meeting agenda.

To ensure the council and public were prepared for decisions, I would work with the city manager, who manages the day-to-day operations, and relevant parties.

At the meeting, I would guide the discussion, encourage future research, and promote involvement from all council members.

After discussions, the council votes to act, not the mayor. On general business, the mayor normally does not vote unless there is a tie.

The mayor sets the tone for policy discussion and public hearings.  Outside these hearings, the mayor facilitates discussions among the public, business owners, non-profit entities, and other interested parties. It is important to remain professional.

At the Change in Form of Government Study Committee, we did just that. At the onset, it seemed like a political battleground filled with litigation.

As chair, I navigated through the process without getting stuck in political games and unnecessary egos with the goal always to find the best possible outcome. My committee followed suit, and together we achieved transparency, cooperation, and compromise.

Moabites want our community to express more unity, kindness, transparency and collaboration. I will help to bring us towards this goal through firm compassionate leadership.

Increasing the opportunity for people to find housing to match their income will be a major focus of my efforts. I will work to prioritize the spending of taxpayer’s money, focusing on "needs" rather than "wants."

We can find solutions to local issues by bringing people together from different viewpoints in a collaborative environment. By tapping into our local resources of intelligent, creative, talented and dedicated people, we can resolve our issues.

There are many priority issues facing Moab at this time, and the pandemic has exacerbated many of these issues. But, what I am hearing the most concern about is how the residents of our community are starting to feel lost in the crowds.

As your mayor, I will ensure that the citizens of this community are heard. I will make sure that the city’s resources are utilized in a way that will benefit the community.

For example, I will use my connections with federal and state partners to secure funding for infrastructure improvements without the need to raise property taxes.

One of the most important roles of the mayor is facilitating city council meetings. The mayor must be able to conduct these meetings in an effective and efficient manner through the use of Roberts Rules of Order.

At the same time, it is important that the city council and staff have the opportunity to present their position and most importantly that the citizens are allowed to be heard.
