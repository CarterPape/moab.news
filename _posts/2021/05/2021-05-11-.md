# Grand County gets new political party officers

## Dems keep Walker, Marienfeld

At its virtual party convention on May 3, the Grand County Democratic Party re-elected Kevin Walker as its chair and Kya Marienfeld as its vice chair.

Walker won his campaign last year for an at-large seat on the Grand County Commission. He is also now beginning his third two-year term as chair of the local Democratic Party.

Marienfeld is a Wildlands Attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. She is also the chair of the Moab City Planning Commission. She has served on the commission since 2018 years.

During the convention, party officers and the former head of the local party, Bob Greenberg, answered questions about its strategy moving going into the Moab City Council and mayoral races this year, along with questions about the larger partisan picture in Moab.

Walker responded to a question about the Grand County Commission and Moab City Council currently being dominated by Democrats â€” or liberals, at least, since the two are nonpartisan for the time being.

He said there is a diversity of opinion within the party and on the elected boards, and he values the range of ideas that people have within the party and the boards.

Greenberg chimed in as well to express a similar sentiment.

## GOP elects Green, Walston

At its party convention on April 14 at Canyonlands by Night and Day, the Grand County Republican Party elected Cricket Green as its chair and Bryon Walston as its vice chair.

Green most recently sat on the Grand County Form of Government Study Committee, whose proposal voters rejected in 2021 in favor of a more status quo form. Prior to that, she served on the Grand County Planning Commission. She ran for a seat on the Moab City Council in 2015 and lost.

Walston owns an H&R Block franchise in Moab and Moab Premier Properties, a local real estate brokerage and management company. After a failed bid for city council in 2019, he also served on the Grand County Planning Commission until this year.

Green said in an interview that the party's poor showing in 2021, when the only conservative candidate to run for county commission was Stephen Stocks, had to do with COVID-19
