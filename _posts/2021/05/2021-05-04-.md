Construction of [the new campus of Utah State University at Moab](https://www.usu.edu/today/story/usu-breaks-ground-on-highly-anticipated-new-moab-campus) reached a milestone on Friday, April 30, when workers secured the final beam of the new campus, which is known as topping out or topping off.

Campus Executive Director Lianna Etchberger and the construction workers on the project each signed the beam before putting it in place.

The university is targeting a 2022 grand opening.

## The middle school basically gave away its old supplies in a surplus sale

Collectors and others hoping to get their hands on items from the old Grand County Middle School got their chance at a surplus sale last week.

The district all but gave away troves of items from books to calculators, compasses to chairs, and everything in between, selling even large collections of items for $10.

The surplus sale came days after the new Margaret L. Hopkin Middle School opened to students, teachers, and staff on April 27. Demolition on the old building next door is set to begin at the end of May, according to Grand County School District Superintendent Taryn Kay.

## The Moab Rotary Club does something good (for once)

I'm kidding, of course, by implying that the Rotary Club never does anything good. Their whole thing is doing good (and getting credit for it, which is their prerogative).

Here's the press release they sent me with this photo:

{% capture quote %}
The Moab Rotary Club has started a collaboration with the Hope Alliance in Park City and the three Rotary clubs of Park City and our very own Moab Free Health Clinic!

This weekend was the first of many to come, of two days of vision clinic held at the free health clinic and sponsored by the Rotary clubs of Park City and Moab. The clinic were able to test and prescribe glasses for over 50 people in the two days they were here and the glasses will be shipped to Moab in a few weeks and free of charge to the recipients.

It was a great success as it always has been. Several of our local Rotarians were hands-on and helped both days of the clinic. The program has been going on for 3 years with a twice a year visit for one day.

However the need for free vision test and prescription glasses is much bigger here in Moab so we are working on getting funding organized that the clinic can be happening every second month.

Also, the Grand County school district is interested in getting kids of families who are uninsured or under-insured participating in this program, and we are working on this with the county school nurse Mary.

Anyone who would like to support this project can donate directly to the Moab Rotary Club.
