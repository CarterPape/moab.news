I'm kidding, of course, by implying that the Rotary Club never does anything good. Their whole thing is doing good (and getting credit for it, which is their prerogative).

Here's the press release they sent me with this photo:

The Moab Rotary Club has started a collaboration with the Hope Alliance in Park City and the three Rotary clubs of Park City and our very own Moab Free Health Clinic!

This weekend was the first of many to come, of two days of vision clinic held at the free health clinic and sponsored by the Rotary clubs of Park City and Moab. The clinic were able to test and prescribe glasses for over 50 people in the two days they were here and the glasses will be shipped to Moab in a few weeks and free of charge to the recipients.

It was a great success as it always has been. Several of our local Rotarians were hands-on and helped both days of the clinic. The program has been going on for 3 years with a twice a year visit for one day.

However the need for free vision test and prescription glasses is much bigger here in Moab so we are working on getting funding organized that the clinic can be happening every second month.

Also, the Grand County school district is interested in getting kids of families who are uninsured or under-insured participating in this program, and we are working on this with the county school nurse Mary.

Anyone who would like to support this project can donate directly to the Moab Rotary Club.
