# Raw: Documents to read and process

I started the day *late* and just cleaned my inbox and desk. Here are the records I digitized and threw away (some of which I have already reviewed but mainly just need to house somewhere):

- [League of Women Voters of Utah on Utah Abortion Laws]({% include asset_path file_name = "2020-Dec_Abortion Law Study .pdf" %})
- Utahraptor State Park media packet documents
    - [Dalton Wells Quarry map]({% include asset_path file_name = "UGS stuff bone map.jpeg" %})
    - [Moab geologic map]({% include asset_path file_name = "UGS stuff Moab map.jpeg" %})
    - [Utah dinosaur record]({% include asset_path file_name = "UGS stuff dino record.jpeg" %})
- [Editorial writing (by Doug)]({% include asset_path file_name = "editorial writing.pdf" %})
- [Margaret L. Hopkin Middle School self-guided tour pamphlet](({% include asset_path file_name = "MLH self-guided tour.pdf" %})
- [Moab Area Affordable Housing Plan]({% include asset_path file_name = "2017%20Affordable%20Housing%20Plan_201710261141517719.pdf" %}) (five years old)
