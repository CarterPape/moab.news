# Another skip day

Ok, no more skip days. Skip days are BAD.

My excuse is that my mom and grandmother were in town and kept coming to visit me in the middle of the day, which prevented me from doing any writing for the newsletter but I appreciated nonetheless.

What's more important: My family, or one issue of the newsletter?
