# The T-I has pissed now off everyone on Creekside Lane; and more

I spent today writing up an explanation of [some of the licensing and copyright]({% link exclusive-use.md %}) on works on this site.

I still need to lay out how exactly articles themselves are licensed (probably "all rights reserved" for now, since it's reporting that I'm doing for *The Times-Independent*) and how the source code is licensed (I'm thinking I'll use [my preferred license for source code](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)).

## Everyone on Creekside Lane is mad at *The T-I*

I've already spent [two](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/hedin-rural-residents-seek-to-prevent-residential-development/) [articles](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/landowners-longtime-retirement-plan-at-risk/) reporting on the situation out at Creekside Estates (on Creekside Lane).

The second article was a product of being unable to contact Larry White, who is the property owner with the Planned Unit Development, for the first article. I tried and failed to call him for the first article; we published it.

He complained after it ran that it was a one-sided article that was biased against him (incorrect) and that we didn't contact him about it (I tried, but he is right that I never spoke to him).

To ensure we told his side of the story, we published the second article. That prompted yet more complaints â€” both from White and from his neighbors.

I have concluded that White is an ass, and his neighbors are asses. I'll leave it up to Judge Don Torgerson to decide who is in the right legally on this matter.

Regardless how mad everyone is, I'm not returning to the subject until April 19 at the earliest. That's when there is an evidentiary hearing in the case that White's neighbors have brought against the Grand County commissioners.

For [archival purposes]({% link _posts/2021/04/2021-04-08-.md %}), here is [the link to the docket search page](https://www.utcourts.gov/cal/search.php?t=c&c=&p=&f=&l=&b=&d=2021-05-19&loc=1011D), where the hearing will appear a few days before it is held. That page lead (hopefully) to a link to the [WebEx](https://www.webex.com) hearing itself.

The hearing is at 9 a.m. the day after a county commission meeting. I'm betting neither Christina Sloan nor I are happy about that.

## Off-highway vehicle noise ordinances are nearly final

The commission is meeting three times next week to finalize OHV-related ordinances and land use code amendments. It looks like the Monday meeting is with local OHV businesses.

## American Rescue Plan thing

Mayor Emily Niehaus a few weeks back sent me [this FAQ document]({% include asset_path file_name="ARPA-FAQs.pdf" %}) when I asked about the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act on the city budget. I just needed to put it somewhere.
