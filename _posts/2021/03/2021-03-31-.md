# Moab could safely increase its water usage by 50% or more

Preliminary estimates from a state water agency show that the Spanish Valley Watershed, which contains Moab and Spanish Valley, can safely withdraw 50-100% more water than it currently uses each year.

The Division of Water Rights, the state agency charged with determining how much water communities can safely pull from their aquifers, has been studying the question locally since around 2014, looking closely at Moab to determine where the valley stands with its water budget.

The division discussed the estimates during a March 17 meeting of the Moab Area Watershed Partnership, a coalition of many local stakeholders interested in protecting Moab's watershed.

## USGS studies shed light on Moab's water budget

The estimates are informed in no small part by recent studies commissioned by the U.S. Geological Survey, which in turn refined a similar study in 1976. Each has attempted to overview the water budget for Moab and Spanish Valley.

Researchers published one such study in 2019, dramatically shifting the science on how exactly water moves through Moab's watershed. What didn't change were the top-line estimates from the 1976 study regarding how much groundwater in total was available for human use.

The 1976 study, led by USGS Hydrologist C. T. Sumsion, concluded that 14,000 acre-feet of groundwater are available for use each year in the Moab-area watershed. The 2019 study, led by USGS Hydrologist Melissa Masbruch, refined the estimate to between 14,000 and 16,000.

The numbers suggest that the valley has ample room for developing its water usage, even as the climate changes and brings more evaporation and less aquifer refilling.

## Climate change likely to decrease groundwater availability in Moab

Increased evaporation is not the only means by which water could leave Moab before it is captured for use, according to Seth Arens, a member of the Western Water Assessment team at Colorado University.

Arens said in a presentation during the March 17 watershed partnership meeting that climate change could also yield more extreme storms and drier soil, meaning more runoff and less water going into aquifers.

"More precipitation will fall from short-duration events as temperature warms," Arens said. Specifically, storms that today only happen every 100 years could become 30-40% more frequent, he said.

All of the effects add up to "medium to high confidence that groundwater recharge will decrease throughout the 21st century," Arens concluded.

## Tapping the Colorado River to build resilience and capacity

On top of efforts to create a groundwater management plan, local officials are already enforcing water conservation in an effort to make more efficient use of the water available in the valley. For example, city officials implemented water usage requirements on new lodging developments in 2019.

However, in the face of likely decreases in the availability locally of water, and amid recent drought in Moab, local officials also want to build the valley's resilience to dry conditions. One way of doing that is pulling water out of the Colorado River.

Although larger-scale events could decrease flows in the Colorado River the same way Moab's watershed is likely to be negatively impacted by climate change,
