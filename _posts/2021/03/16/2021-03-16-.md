# The American Rescue Plan could replace Grand's lost 2020 tax revenues.

According to Chris Baird, Grand County commission administrator, the American Rescue Plan could provide $1.8 million to the county government, which had a $1.4 million loss in revenue on the year in 2020.

The second quarter of 2020 (April, May, and June) yielded overall losses in tax revenue for Grand County compared to the second quarter of 2019. Quarters three and four set respective records for overall tax revenue, but it wasn't enough to recover from the second quarter losses.

Our national parks and lodging establishments were fully or mostly closed during the month of April.

The federal dollars could replace lost revenue rather than needing to be spent in specific ways, as was the case with previous grants during the pandemic from Congress.

Baird sounded like he didn't know for sure and still needed to verify all of this.
