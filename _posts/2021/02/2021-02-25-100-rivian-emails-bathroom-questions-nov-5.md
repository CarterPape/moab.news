# Rivian emails: More bathroom questions (Nov. 5)

Following [an apparent call]({% post_url 2021/02/2021-02-25-051-rivian-emails-gpd-tries-to-call %}) between Josh Lyons, the project manager at GPD Group overseeing the charging station project for Rivian, and Grand County Planning Director Mila Dunbar-Irwin on Oct. 29, Lyons follows up on Nov. 5, seven days later to ask about. Quick emails on the subject ensue, all on the same day.

Mila,

Good morning! I wanted to follow up again on the Rivian project. We have had several conversations since we last spoke here internally.

Regarding Phase 1 being all parking and charging stations, you indicated we would still need approval letters for the well and septic. I just want to ensure I understand exactly what you mean by approval letters.

Are you indicating we have to have the septic and well designs completely finished, submitted to the State agencies and fully permitted before we can apply for site plan approval of phase 1? Or just some letter from each of the agencies indicating that we will be able to receive water rights and septic systems for the future project phase 2?

Thank you,
{% endcapture %}

Hi Josh,

More the latter than the former. You can submit a site plan, however, you won't have final approval of the site plan until the state agencies have permitted water and septic. So it's up to you in what order you'd like to proceed.

If you'd like the County to start our review of the other components of the site plan, we can do that, and take it to the Development Review Team, at which point, you'll get a letter with comments and a requirement for permitted water and septic.

Hope that helps,

Mila

That does help but for the Phase 1 charging and parking lot, there would be no retail buildings and therefore no use for water and septic. I would assume for Phase 1 they wouldnâ€™t be necessary at all to be installed for no specific use.

I would advise that you check with the health department as to whether or not a bathroom will be required for the charging station.

No problem. I will check.

Just that Rivian wants the charging stations installed before next summer and if water and septic need full approvals just for charging, that would not be possible as getting the well would take over a year from my discussions.

If required, what about a temporary restroom facilities until the permanent amenities are constructed?

Anything regarding restrooms is under the purview of the Health Department. You'll need to check with them.
