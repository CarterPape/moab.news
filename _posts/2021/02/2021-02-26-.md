# More Rivian emails (but I'm not keeping this up)

All right, it was worth a try to properly format all these emails, but I need to just find a way to read through them all without being anal about creating a proper record for all of them. I have a pending GRAMA request for likely hundreds of emails related to the High-Density Housing Overlay, so I need to just figure out how to read emails from the format in which I got these Rivian emails.
