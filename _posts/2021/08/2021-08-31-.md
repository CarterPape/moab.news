# Municipal candidates on housing, role of mayor

## Council candidates on housing

According to experts in housing policy, the greatest opportunity Moab has to decrease housing costs is zoning reform. Needed reforms would allow more and different kinds of low- and middle-income housing to be constructed. Another force driving up housing costs in Moab is demand from second homeowners.

1. How will you overcome the neighborhood defending (or NIMBYism) that plagues efforts to reform the city's zoning?
1. Should Moab allow more housing development to complement the demand from second homeowners? If not, how would you protect full-time locals in the local housing market?

I support locals defending or speaking up for what they want in their neighborhoods. Changes in such things like density could have a negative impact on the current residents, and they need to have a voice.

Reform of city zoning in the future may be limited to future, undeveloped parcels while working with developers. We must work to develop affordable housing for full-time, year-round residents.

If elected, I look forward to working on the Walnut Lane project and other projects that will hopefully help alleviate the stress of Moab families finding a place to live.

Should Moab allow more housing development to complement the demand from second homeowners? If not, how would you protect full-time locals in the local housing market?

{% capture quote %}
Options for second home owners already exist. I do not think we should complement the demand.

Development should compliment full-time locals and protect options for full-time residents. It would be great to see incentives for sellers and developers to sell to locals before second home owners.

The vision for Walnut Lane is exciting and will benefit Moab families.

In the county, the High-Density Housing Overlay the county passed in 2019, which restricts occupation to those working full-time and residents of Grand County, is a good move.

We need to continue working towards affordable housing for low- to middle-income families in Moab.

Proverbs 29:18 says "Where there is no vision, the people perish." I know from many conversations how frustrated many of the citizens of Moab are about the tourist-driven expansion, but tough love demands that we face the truth: We're never going back to life as we knew it 5 years ago.

My hope is that, instead, we can reason together to reverse a little of the damage done while moving forward to ensure everyone contributing to our economy has a safe and secure home. We need a new and better vision!

Yes we need to build more housing, but judiciously and dependent on what hydrologists determine our aquifer resources to be.

That said, not everyone who works here needs a house. I've heard the idea of bunkhouses thrown around, but my experience with seasonal guides and bike people strongly suggests that's not appropriate.

Instead, how about extended-stay hostels? A small private room with wi-fi, shared baths, and a communal kitchen with room-specific shelving and delineated refrigerator space? Perhaps a bit bigger room for couples with a private bath? One-month renewable leases and everyone has upkeep responsibilities. Pets extra.

The simplest and easiest solution is to reform zoning in areas where it will have the smallest impact on locals. Newer areas outside of fully developed, original neighborhoods are a good place to start.

Virtually everyone who comes to Moab has access to a vehicle and doesn’t have to live within a few blocks of Main Street. Apartments are what Moab needs, and there are plenty of great locations for apartments that wouldn’t cause a rift with existing neighbors.

{% capture quote %}
The demand for more housing is definitely there. So, if we restrict the supply, prices will only go up more.

Full-time locals who already own a home benefit from any increase in their property values. For those who don’t own, there are some good ideas out there on deed restricted properties with a lower bar for entry.

And, again, apartments should be there to bridge the gap between home ownership and renting.

I see how the inability to find safe, affordable housing causes suffering across our entire community every day in my work at Seekhaven. It is the reason I decided to run for council.

Affordable housing and keeping existing neighborhoods livable and community-focused are both important, and they shouldn’t conflict if we do things right. To start, we should make simple but targeted code changes to support solutions we actually all want.

These include making it easier for locals to build ADUs, modernizing parking requirements, and fixing incentive programs so that newly built, deed-restricted housing for locals is actually financially feasible.

{% capture quote %}
Any future increases in density should be for housing for people who live and work in the Moab area.

We know that the free market is not going to solve our housing problems --- no matter how many new units get built. The extreme demand from outside buyers for vacation homes means that they always out-compete locals trying to find or keep safe housing in town.

We need to localize our local housing market again, and we can do this with zoning and incentive programs that make it easy to build dedicated workforce housing and difficult to build second homes.

On heavy traffic roads, change the codes to allow homeowners to build noise walls that are more than four inches up to six inches, unless it blocks the view of an intersection. In some places, build noise walls along the sidewalks.

No, and it’s all about universal basic income, meaning we rewrite the tax code like this:

We make a 10-12% tax on the tourism industry that will be given to year-round locals at \$500 per month after the first year, so we can build up a bank to make sure everyone gets it.

This is not unemployment!

Let's say that 8% of the tax goes toward the \$500 per month, and let’s say the tax is set at 12%. We take the remaining 4% and give it to non-profits each month and change the non-profits.

I like thoughtful, methodical progress. We can initially focus on building out current allowed densities, which can inform future zoning reform.

Housing policy should be data-driven and community-led. We should know what we want as much as we know what we don’t want, finding solutions on common ground that reinforce rather than undermine what people love about their neighborhoods.

This takes engagement from everyone and a willingness to fully workshop ideas. Envisioning solutions should be exciting! We are only limited by our imaginations.

Our economic health as a community --- all of us --- depends deeply on ensuring secure housing for all.

Market-driven housing solutions are not enough. We need to continue developing parallel frameworks for creating housing in addition to just incentivizing developers to be part of the solution. Creativity and collaboration are important.

Moabites are becoming homeowners with the help of Community Rebuilds, the housing authority, and the land trust. We should expand on their success and use zoning reform to support diverse solutions --- accessory dwelling units, tiny homes, and more.

We can also consider emergency measures like Crested Butte’s program to facilitate temporary camping on private property. These measures can act as test runs for more long-reaching policy ideas.

## Mayoral candidates on their commitment to the job

Without a vote on legislation, the vital role the mayor plays is being the face of the city --- a liaison between Moab and the rest of the world, particularly the State of Utah. Another major element of the job is conflict resolution between council members, city staff, and the public.

Moab needs representation in our local and state level that is approachable, reasonable, and trustworthy. Trust takes time to build and is rooted in relationships.

Each citizen of Moab, regardless of race, sexuality and income, has important knowledge and experiences that deserve to be heard, not just the elite.

If elected mayor, I will consider it my full-time job and do everything I can to make a Moab we can be proud of.

I am not afraid of conflict, but I try to avoid it with transparency and education.
