# Municipal election candidate introductions

We have 13 candidates vying for three elected offices this year — seven for one mayoral seat, six for two city council seats. I asked each of them for the following things:

1. **A photo of yourself.** This preferably will be a standard portrait (from shoulders up). It must be a photo we can use in our ongoing coverage of your campaign. If you do not have a recent photo of yourself, let me know, and we can schedule a time and place for me to get a photo of you.
1. **50 to 100 words about who you are.** This should include information about your current occupation, your involvement with public boards and local politics, how long you have lived in Moab, and where (roughly) you live in the city.

Here are their responses:

## V. Kent Green (mayor)
