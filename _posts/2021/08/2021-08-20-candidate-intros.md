# Municipal election candidate introductions

We have 13 candidates vying for three elected offices this year — seven for one mayoral seat, six for two city council seats. I asked each of them for the following things:

1. **A photo of yourself.** This preferably will be a standard portrait (from shoulders up). It must be a photo we can use in our ongoing coverage of your campaign. If you do not have a recent photo of yourself, let me know, and we can schedule a time and place for me to get a photo of you.
1. **50 to 100 words about who you are.** This should include information about your current occupation, your involvement with public boards and local politics, how long you have lived in Moab, and where (roughly) you live in the city.

Here are their responses:

## V. Kent Green (mayor)

I have lived on the westside of Moab since 1997.  I am the Executive Director for the Friends of Arches and Canyonlands Parks, the official non-profit partner with the National Park Service.  I was elected to the Grand County Council for two terms from 2001 thru 2008. During my term on the County Council I initiated the Moab Area Partnership for Seniors (MAPS) that was responsible for the development of the Moab Regional Hospital, Canyonlands Care Center, Grand Center, and MAPS Senior Housing.  I currently am the chair of the Canyonlands Health Care Special Service District and serve on the Moab Tailings Steering Committee.

I run my own law firm as a general practitioner attorney.  I grew up in Moab and have always lived roughly two blocks east of the library.  As an adult, I have lived in Moab for most of my life except for my education—which took me to Salt Lake City, Utah; Lima, Peru; Bologna, Italy; and Topeka, Kansas.  My experience in politics has been varied, I chaired a study committee for one year, engaged in local politics through my work as an attorney, and ran bids for office in the Grand County elections previously.

My name is Luke, I was born in Poland, but my family immigrated to the US when I was young and I grew up in Illinois. I moved to Moab five years ago to take a job with Seekhaven, where I am currently the Deputy Executive Director, helping provide services and support to members of our community facing domestic abuse and sexual assault. I am also a member of the city Planning Commission, where I work to represent the needs of other working-class families in Moab. I live in a sweat-equity home I helped build in the Valley View neighborhood.

I am 66 years old, never married, and "Covid retired" from the bicycle industrial complex. In my 45 year career I have managed bike shops both large and small (+ a couple of men's fine clothing stores/departments), coached and wrenched for state, national, and world champions (my junior team won the 24 Hours Of Moab in the late '90s), lead a few racing organizations, performed wind tunnel modeling of bike racers and triathletes, and performed hundreds of bicycle fittings utilizing the latest science and technologies.

As a nationally recognised fitter I've been fortunate to be able to choose where I've lived while always having instant employment. Originally from Omaha, I've also lived in Denver (22 years), Ogden, Naples FL, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Wichita, Nor Cal, and other locales. I moved to Moab in late Spring of 2018 to see if this would be a great place to eventually retire. It seems to be so. Moab, since I started coming here in 1989 for mountain biking, has been my spiritual mecca because of the serenity and awe-inspiring landscape.

But when I settled here I became greatly concerned about the repressive policies concerning eBike access to trails and pathways, so I joined the Motorized Trails Committee at its inception as the first eBike Representative (2020- my first political win against fierce competition) and also joined the Trail Mix committee as a voting member. I am confident in saying that I laid the groundwork for the recent opening of all city multi-use paths to eBikes and have spoken before the current city council on a couple of occasions. My efforts are also known to the county commission.

In addition to all regular duties and concerns of the city council, should I be elected I will focus on enhancement of opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians, building Moab's reputation for the utilization of solar power, and developing the management of expectations of our 3,000,000ish annual guests. I believe that with the privilege of living in such astounding beauty comes the obligation to display thoughtful and sustainable practices of existence. One way that I will personally exhibit this is by living car-free and relying solely on my eBicycles. I have already lived 15 years car-free and Moab's Winter weather is far fairer than places such as Denver and Minneapolis....

My name is Jason Taylor, I am the Utah Operations Manager for Western River Expeditions and The Moab Adventure Center.  My wife and I also own Canyonlands Jeep and Car Rentals.  We have lived in Moab since 1997, and have 3 teenagers currently attending school in Grand County. During the past 24 years, I've served Moab and Grand County by volunteering on the Grand County Emergency Medical Services District board, Moab Area Travel Council, Moab Motorized Trails Committee, Sustainable Trails Committee, and the Airport Board.  I'm excited for the chance to continue to serve this great community.

In my 16 years in Moab I have worked with many nonprofits including KZMU, YGP, Outward Bound, Grand Area Mentoring, and Moab Pride. I am currently on the board of Resiliency Hub, an organization promoting community sustainability, and have served on the Grand County Planning Commission since June of 2020. In 2020, I worked with Rural Utah Project on voter registration and outreach in Grand County. I’ve spent many years in the service industry and currently bartend at 98 Center. I live with my husband and 15 month old daughter in a small house we built on Locust Lane.
