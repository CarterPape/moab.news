# Shit that just isn't very important

I guess I took last week off from writing here?

I have stories to write about housing, the fire, water quality in Moab, redistricting... Feeding the beast requires that I write about these things first.

Isn't there a free newspaper in town that could cover all of this instead? I would happily hand all these stories over to them to get them off my plate.

## Rotary cooks lunch for middle school kids

I can't make heads or tails of this email Britta wrote, so I'm just pasting it here. I haven't fact-checked it. I promise you I didn't edit it in any way (except to add captions to the photos and add newlines in some places).

Just want you to know all went well here in Moab on the subject of the 6th graders and the BBQ mostly thanks to Monte and Melinda who stepped up big time. Kim and his partner also was very helpful and then Joe and I did the rest .. Hi Hi.

So here's a few photos showing what went down when you feed 100+ HMK “graduating” students in 30 minutes… and all cleaned up and no evidences left for any to complain about in the park after that.

PS. Both teachers and students were very appreciative of the BBQ and even after my 2 minutes “blip” on Rotary to them, they still stayed around… good kids.

and then we also awarded two scholarships the night before at the HS….. despite our lack of April Action Car-show this (and last year) we still had enough funds to help two students into their next adventure. 

and here are the two recipients of this year… well done to both!

If you know what that says, let me know. I see what appears to be a reference to God, perhaps?

They need to hire someone to format press releases. I don't want to do it anymore.

## Rotary builds a yurt for the multicultural center

{% capture quote %}
Thanks to many donations, including that of the Moab Rotary Club, the yurt has helped increase space and capacity for the MVMC. Our yurt is 27' in diameter, totaling 572 square ft (which has been great for social distancing). The yurt also has electricity, heat and a ceiling fan.  We are still working on installing a cooling system and a handicap ramp.

The yurt is a welcoming and safe place for clients and their families.  We have also been able to have staff trainings, youth clubs, fundraising events and partnership meetings in the yurt.  

This extra space allows us to maintain extra distance for our frontline staff who are helping vulnerable people everyday and keep our operations going without delay. Thank you for helping us make this a reality!

They might want to get going on that cooling system. I'm sure they know that.

A small fire broke out on Thursday, June 8 in the backyard of a trailer on Williams Way. Crews quickly responded and suppressed it without much spread to neighboring trailers.

## Southeast Utah doesn't have a lot of water this year

{%- endcapture %}

[A monthly report]({{ water_report_link }}) from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture) indicates that Southeastern Utah (which in the report extends from San Juan County up to part of Daggett County) saw 72% of normal precipitation through June 1.

In historical terms, the Moab region in particular was in the 14th percentile for water availability compared to previous years. In other words, we have had more water in 86% of previous years on record.

Since October, when the water year began, Moab has seen precipitation at or above average in only one month: March. Years with this little precipitation were 2018, 2012, 1989, and 1990.

## JJ Wang gave a high schooler $5,000 toward the cost of college

This man came into the office two weeks ago to buy an ad, thinking he was getting an ad and news coverage from us. He was just getting an ad; we decided it was worth a story in its own right, as well.

Not every Grand County High School graduate gets $5,000, and not every local entity gives out this much money to individual students.

Kaci McKinney won the scholarship of the six students who applied. Wang said she was selected for maintaining a 3.8 grade point average during high school, getting As in the college-level classes she took, working since she was 14, volunteered as a coach for the Moab Area Recreation Center, and more.

## High school seniors graduate in a totally normal ceremony

I mean it was like absolutely normal. I remember one graduate wearing a mask, and that's it. There were masks in the crowd, as well. It looked almost exactly the same as two years ago.
