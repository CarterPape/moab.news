# What is this?

As of May 11, 2021, this is basically just a daily blog that I write for myself, my family, close friends, and my boss.

I am a reporter for The Times-Independent. What I write here is in support of my work for the newspaper.

This website is a place for me to put draft stories, partial stories, lists of links, documents, and anything else I need or want to aggregate in the process of reporting.

Sometimes, it's also a place for me to [vent]({% link _posts/2021/05/2021-05-06-.md %}). For that and other reasons, the standards to which I hold myself on this website are lower than the standards to which I and my employer hold myself in my syndicated work.

Here's an example of how low the standards are here compared to my actual work: Sometimes, you'll see {% draft "text that looks like this." %} That's not a link; that's draft language. Anything blue with squiggly underlines is missing a fact-check.

Maybe I'm unsure about it, maybe I was just too lazy to verify what I wrote at the moment I wrote it.

In reality, this whole website should be in {% draft "blue, squiggly underlines" %}. I am the only person who edits it, and since it's all pre-publication, it is not fully fact-checked the way [my syndicated work](https://www.moabtimes.com/?s=carter+pape) is.

Yes, I am aware this is a publicly available website. No, I am not promoting it over [my employer's publication](https://www.moabtimes.com). No, I do not want you, dear reader, to share links to this website.

It's easier for it to just be an unnoticed, online publication. Likely, though, there will come a day that I have to put it behind a password wall or something because I just have not firmed it up into something that I am comfortable being truly public.
