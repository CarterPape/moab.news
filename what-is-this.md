# What is this?

As of Oct. 7, 2021, this is basically just a scratch pad for myself.

I am a reporter for The Times-Independent. What I write here is in support of my work for the newspaper.

This website is a place for me to plan, write drafts, write partial stories, list links, aggregate documents, and do anything else I need or want in the process of reporting.

Sometimes, it's also a place for me to [vent]({% link _posts/2021/05/2021-05-06-.md %}). For that and other reasons, the standards to which I hold myself on this website are lower than the standards to which I and my employer hold myself in my syndicated work.

Here's an example of how low the standards are here compared to my actual work: Sometimes, you'll see {% draft "text that looks like this." %} That's not a link; that's draft language. Anything blue with squiggly underlines is missing a fact-check or is a detail for me to later fill in.

In reality, this whole website should be in {% draft "blue, squiggly underlines" %}. I am the only person who edits it, and since it's all pre-publication, it is not fully fact-checked the way [my syndicated work](https://www.moabtimes.com/?s=carter+pape) is.

Also, I just like making and maintaining websites. This is a way for me to do that while also pursuing the ends of my job as a reporter.
