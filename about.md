I send out this newsletter every weekday around 8 a.m. with updates on what is going on around Moab and Grand County.

In my job as a local reporter, I cover a lot of what is going on in Moab, including county government, tourism, public health, water issues, crime, and a lot more. I know a lot about what I don't cover, as well, because my editor reports it.

I am responsible for the content of this newsletter, not my editor, and not my employer. Any misstatements or opinions expressed in this newsletter (and hopefully there are none of either) are solely my fault.

If you have any news tips or feedback, you can email me at `#####@moab.news` (except replace `#####` with my first name).
